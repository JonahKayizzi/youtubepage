The goal of this project is to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page
Focus is on making the media elements show up. 
Embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.

Its picked from Microverse's pre-enrollment bootcamp exploring HTML/CSS skills
